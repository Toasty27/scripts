# Shell Scripts

### connect-remote
Script used for managing multiple remote connections for multiple sites. Designed to be as generic as possible for use with various command-line utilities (although initially designed with ssh port-forwarding in mind). Should be easily adaptable for various other tasks, like starting multiple tmux sesions, or multiple iperf sessions, or monitoring multiple remote hosts via ping.

### ip-scan
Simple script for scanning IPv4 addresses in parallel. Scans up to 255 addresses at a time. Outputs visible IP addresses in numerical order.

### software-development
Various scripts written to aid in software development. Mostly for mass-editing of files in a repository.
