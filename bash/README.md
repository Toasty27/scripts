# Shell Scripts

### connect-remote
Script used for managing multiple remote connections for multiple sites. Designed to be as generic as possible for use with various command-line utilities (although initially designed with ssh port-forwarding in mind). Should be easily adaptable for various other tasks, like starting multiple tmux sesions, or multiple iperf sessions, or monitoring multiple remote hosts via ping.
